# The Moments Blog

Okay okay, until now you have only see the basic of my projects, but this one have something special, you will need to use a API in order for it to work appropriately
So here is the link(not to the vercel this time) of the API https://github.com/matheusbattisti/curso_adonis_api_yt/tree/main/start 
and after using the downloading and using the API you should download the repository do all the setup for it and its ready to use!

This is a Angular Project, one of my favorites frameworks! Its a blog that allow you to post stuff, comment and etc.

I hope you enjoy this one!
